# Project Two

This repository contains the final dashboard code and the README file for Project Two, completed as part of my Computer Science program.

## Maintaining, Readable and Adaptable Programs
To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I follow certain best practices such as writing clean, modular, and well-documented code. In Project One, I created a CRUD Python module that I used in Project Two to connect the dashboard widgets to the database. This module helped to keep the codebase maintainable, readable, and adaptable. For example, by separating the database operations into separate functions, it made the code more organized, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors. In the future, I could use this CRUD module in other projects to connect to databases and perform database operations efficiently.

## Problem Solving Approaches as a Computer Scientist
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, and then developing algorithms to solve each of them. When approaching the database or dashboard requirements requested by Grazioso Salvare, I first understood their requirements and constraints, and then designed the database schema and implemented the dashboard accordingly.

Compared to previous assignments in other courses, this project required me to focus more on the business logic of the application and design a solution that could effectively address Grazioso Salvare's needs. In the future, I would use similar techniques and strategies to create databases that meet other client requests, such as understanding the requirements, constraints, and potential future changes that may need to be incorporated into the database.

## The Role of Computer Scientists in Industry
Computer scientists design and develop software systems that are essential for the operation of businesses, organizations, and individuals. They create and implement algorithms that optimize and automate processes, improve data storage and retrieval, and facilitate communication and collaboration.

My work on this type of project, creating a database and dashboard solution for Grazioso Salvare, could help the company to do their work better by providing an effective tool to manage their data, extract insights, and make informed decisions. It would enable them to improve their efficiency, reduce costs, and stay ahead of their competitors.
